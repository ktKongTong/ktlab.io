### flash

Recently, I did a lot of meaningless stuff. 
- use Whisper(an openAI  speech recognition model) build a collection of  [bedtime news](https://btnews.ktlab.io/) which is a political commentary channel at bilibili.
- use nuxt build this website.
- try kotlin and jetpack compose.
- relearn operating system with a lession from NJU at bilibili. here is the [link](https://space.bilibili.com/202224425/channel/collectiondetail?sid=1116786).
- and...,seem like no nothing else😨.


### some opinions

#### note-taking app, about yuque

Notion release notion AI. Evernote release evernote AI. Microsoft announce Microsoft 365 Copilot.
I googled, but didn‘t find any news about Yuque and AI. I used yuque to take notes and pay for the premium account until 2026.10. 

According to recent news, Yubo, the founder of yuque, has resigned from Ant Group.

It has been a year since Yuque announced that it will be open source, but it has not yet been open source.

Putting these information together, I do really feel a little sad about it, or a little disappointed.

I don't know if it will be better in the future. no confidence. That's also why I build this website.

#### about linux desktop environment
I didn't realize that gaming is not the only reason that i bought a graphic card until recently.

To use stable diffussion and other AI model with an amd graphic card. I have to change my operating system to linux.

I used to hate to use linux desktop environment. I have tried ubuntu, centos, deepin,uos for several years ago(before wsl2 in windows 10). 
At that time, i think that these linux desktop environment provide really horrible experience, like dependency problem, driver problem, and so on.

but now, i think that the experience is not so bad as i thought. maybe it is because i know more about linux.

with the experience of using wsl in the past two years and the deepening of understanding of the operating system, I can use ubuntu as my working operating system.
