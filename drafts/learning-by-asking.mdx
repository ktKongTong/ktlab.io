## pre word
Recently, I am focus on re-learning some base techologies in computer science, like `operating system`, `computer organization and architecture`,`computer network` and so on.

several years ago, I learned these courses in my university and read a lot of book. I get good grades in these courses, at least not bad.

but, I always known that I don't really understand these courses. cause I have no ablitity to rebuild one.

I can't rebuild a computer, even a simple one.

so I want to re-learn these courses. I want to know how to build a computer, how to build everything in computer science.

## why, what and how

{/* I pass the exam. I remember the knowledge */}
